## Overview
Emergency call notifications in Teams are a feature that allows administrators and users to receive alerts when someone in their organisation makes an emergency call using Teams Phone System. The notifications can help responders locate and assist the caller quickly and efficiently. Currently, this is limited to notifying a group of people in a group chat. 

This project was created to help Microsoft customers to  deliver emergency notifications through email, SMS and more. With the only limitation being Power Automate connectors. 

## Benefits
* Extend Emergency Call notifications beyond a Teams Group Chat, including:
  * Email 
  * SMS (through Azure Communication Service)
  * Using 3rd Party solutions, available as Power Automate connectors. 
* Deliver Emergency call notifications dynamically dependant on location. (or other criteria)

## How it works

The core solution extends emergency notifications to email only, but you can tweek the Power Automate flow to utilise any Power Automate connector.
