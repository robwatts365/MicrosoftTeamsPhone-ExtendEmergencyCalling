## 2. Configuration

### Creating the SharePoint List

The first thing you'll need to decide is where to host the SharePoint list holding the data for this solution. 

For the purpose of this guide, I have created a new Team in Microsoft Teams called Emergency Notifications, and I will use this SharePoint site to host my SharePoint list.  

1) Navigate to the SharePoint site you have chosen to host the SharePoint list. 
2) Click the "+ New" button.

3) Select "Blank List".

4) Give your list an appropriate name (I'm using SiteList)
5) Once created, click the gear in the top right hand corner, and select List settings.

6) Under Columns, select the "Title" column.

7) Rename the column's name to "SiteRef".
8) Toggle "Require that this column contains information" to Yes. 
9) Toggle "	Enforce unique values" to Yes.

10) Press OK in the bottom right corner of the window. 
11) Click "Create column".

12) Name the column "Email".
13) Toggle "Require that this column contains information" to Yes.
